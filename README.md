# Overview

`cling`'s name is a play on CLI-ng (as in next-gen) and "cling" the English word. It enables function handlers to _cling_ to [clap](https://clap.rs) user-defined structs ðŸ˜‰.

While writing a command-line application using the terrific [clap](https://clap.rs), developers often write some boilerplate code to find which command the user has executed, collect the input parameter values, and run a handler function that does that job. This quickly gets repetitive for multi-command or multi-level command-line applications. Cling lets you declaratively map functions to clap's structs, and it'll handle all the plumbing for you!

## Key Features
- Connects CLI commands to handlers declaratively via `#[cling(run = "my_function")]`.
- Define handlers as normal unit-testable functions.
- Run handlers on any level of the command tree (middlware-style)
- Handler function arguments are extracted automatically from clap input.
- Handlers can return a [State<T>] value that can be extracted by downstream handlers
- Handlers can be either `sync` or `async` functions.
- Uniform CLI-friendly error handling with colors

## Demo
A quick-and-dirty example to show cling in action might look like the following:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "cling-example"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4.4.1", features = ["derive", "env"] }
tokio = { version = "1.13.0", features = ["full"] }
```

Our `main.rs` might look something like this:
```rust, no_run
use cling::prelude::*;

// -- args --

#[derive(Run, Parser, Debug, Clone)]
#[command(author, version, long_about = None)]
/// A simple multi-command example using cling
struct MyApp {
    #[clap(flatten)]
    pub opts: CommonOpts,
    #[clap(subcommand)]
    pub cmd: Command,
}

#[derive(Collect, Parser, Debug, Clone)]
struct CommonOpts {
    /// Turn debugging information on
    #[arg(short, long, global = true, action = clap::ArgAction::Count)]
    pub verbose: u8,
}

// Commands for the app are defined here.
#[derive(Run, Subcommand, Debug, Clone)]
enum Command {
    /// Honk the horn!
    Honk(HonkOpts),
    #[cling(run = "beep")]
    /// Beep beep!
    Beep,
}

// Options of "honk" command. We define cling(run=...) here to call the
// function when this command is executed.
#[derive(Run, Collect, Parser, Debug, Clone)]
#[cling(run = "honk")]
struct HonkOpts {
    /// How many times to honk?
    times: u8,
}

// -- Handlers --

// We can access &CommonOpts because it derives [Collect]
fn honk(common_opts: &CommonOpts, HonkOpts { times }: &HonkOpts) {
    if common_opts.verbose > 0 {
        println!("Honking {} times", times);
    }

    (0..*times).for_each(|_| {
        print!("Honk ");
    });
    println!("!");
}

// Maybe beeps need to be async!
async fn beep() {
    println!("Beep, Beep!");
}


// -- main --

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> ClingFinished<MyApp> {
    Cling::parse_and_run().await
}
```

Now, let's run it and verify that it works as expected
```console
$ simple-multi-command -v honk 5
Honking 5 times
Honk Honk Honk Honk Honk !

```

# Feature Flags

| Feature  | Activation         | Effect
|----------|--------------------|--------
| `derive` | default            | Enables `#[derive(Run)]` and `#[derive(Collect)]`
| `shlex`  | "shlex" feature    | Enables parsing from text, useful when building REPLs
